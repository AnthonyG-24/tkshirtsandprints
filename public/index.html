      <p><strong>Refund / Return Policy</strong></p>

      <p><strong>No Refund on Custom Items!</strong></p>
      <p>
        Once a mock up has been approved, your item will be moved to production.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after
        receiving your item to request a return (excludes custom work).
      </p>

      <p>
        To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition
        that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original
        packaging. You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.
      </p>

      <p>
        To start a return, you can contact us at
        <a href="mailto:tandktshirtsandprints@gmail.com"
          >tandktshirtsandprints@gmail.com</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p>
        If your return is accepted, we’ll send you a return shipping label, as
        well as instructions on how and where to send your package. Items sent
        back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can always contact us for any return question at
        <a href="mailto:tandktshirtsandprints@gmail.com"
          >tandktshirtsandprints@gmail.com</a
        >.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Damages and Issues</strong></p>
      <p>
        Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if
        the item is defective, damaged, or if you receive the wrong item, so
        that we can evaluate the issue and make it right.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Exceptions / Non-returnable Items</strong></p>
      <p>
        Certain types of items cannot be returned, like perishable goods (such
        as food, flowers, or plants), custom products (such as special orders or
        personalized items), and personal care goods (such as beauty products).
        We also do not accept returns for hazardous materials, flammable
        liquids, or gases. Please get in touch if you have questions or concerns
        about your specific item.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns on sale items or gift cards.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Exchanges</strong></p>
      <p>
        The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item
        you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for
        the new item.
      </p>

      <p><strong>European Union 14-Day Cooling Off Period</strong></p>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding the above, if the merchandise is being shipped into the
        European Union, you have the right to cancel or return your order within
        14 days, for any reason and without a justification. As above, your item
        must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused,
        with tags, and in its original packaging. You’ll also need the receipt
        or proof of purchase.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Refunds</strong></p>
      <p>
        We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and
        let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be
        automatically refunded on your original payment method within 10
        business days. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or
        credit card company to process and post the refund too.
      </p>
      <p>
        If more than 15 business days have passed since we’ve approved your
        return, please contact us at
        <a href="mailto:tandktshirtsandprints@gmail.com"
